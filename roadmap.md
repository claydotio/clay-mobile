Clay Mobile Roadmap
===================

  - [Kik](#kik)
  - [Google Play](#google-play)
  - [Amazon Appstore](#amazon-appstore)

## Kik

**Goal:** Iterate on the app until it engages users in games (subjective) and grows virally (K-factor > 1)

**Primary Timeline:** August 1st - September 10th

Some of these timelines may seem drawn out (eg 9 days to implement game sharing) - but hopefully the length
takes into account the A/B tests we're running for previous phases and any time that needs to be spent on the
API or other miscellaneous 'base' improvements. Of course, we'll shoot to beat the deadlines and can move up
later deadlines.

### Phase 1 - Game Discovery

  - Timeline: August 1st - August 29th
  - Specs: [Game Discovery](./specs/game-discovery.md), [Game Discovery](./specs/game-view.md), [Swipe Bar](./specs/swipe-bar.md)
  - Basic deploy (no staging or rollbacks)

### Phase 2 - Game Sharing (external)

  - Timeline: August 29th - Sept 3rd
  - Specs: [Game Sharing (external)](./specs/game-sharing-external.md), [Game Details](./specs/game-details.md)
  - Cristian starts the 20th - some of the above time will be spent changing the UX of game discovery phase
  - Staging and rollbacks added to deploy process
  - Phase 2 includes continual running of A/B tests from Phase 1

### Phase 3 - Challenger Discovery

  - Timeline: September 3rd - September 10th
  - Specs: [Challenger Discovery](./specs/challenger-discovery.md)
  - Phase 3 includes continual running of A/B tests from Phases 1 and 2

### Phase 4 - Personal Stream
- Timeline: September 10th - September 17th
- Specs: [Personal Stream](./specs/personal-stream.md)
- Phase 2 includes continual running of A/B tests from Phases 1, 2 and 3

### Phase 5 - Friendship Interactions
  - Timeline: TBD

### Phase 6 - Game Sharing Internal
  - Timeline: TBD

### Phase 7 - Marketplace Shares (External)
  - Timeline: TBD

## Google Play

**Goal:** Branch out from Kik into an ecosystem with more money and a higher ceiling
**Primary Timeline:**

### Convert app to APK for Google Play

  - Timeline: TBD
  - Ask for contact list?

#### Convert all games to APKs

  - Do it for every game (with or without developer permission) and give user option to install via that (for better retention)
    - Make sure we have *something* in the APK to retain that user (eg bring back to marketplace) like the swipe bar

  _ Give developers the option to use the APK to get on Google Play (or we add it for them)
    - This opens up the door to other platforms like Tango (messaging app), WeChat 'native' games, etc...

## Amazon Appstore

**Goal:**

**Timeline:** TBD (< 1 week)

Most important part here is the biz side (working with Amazon to get featured)

## iOS App Store

  - Timeline: TBD

## WeChat, Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat???, WhatsApp, Line, KakaoTalk
